# Why write Golang?
Go come up with the concept of building a language to support concurrency. Also, Go aims to gave more performance than older programming languages for both compile and interpret language. From this, it gave us concurrency using go-routine and will compiles to machine code directly without interpretation or VM (like JVM).

Moreover, it has static typing! This will solve issues (actually web-developer) met using JavaScript. It will check types every time we compile codes.

Last but not the least, it scalable for building large-scale systems which in the future if there're any problem, it will solve and get attention more faster because it was backed and develop by Google.
