# Go's basic types:

bool (Boolean)

int(8/16/32/63) (Integer) *up to 64-bit

uint(8/16/32/63/ptr) (Un-signed) *up to 64-bit

byte (actually uint8) - from ChatGPT, In many contexts, particularly when dealing with binary data or raw byte streams, unsigned integers (byte or uint8) are preferred because they directly represent byte values without any ambiguity about whether the value is intended to be interpreted as a signed or unsigned integer. This choice aligns well with Go's philosophy of explicitness and simplicity.

float(32/64)

complex(64/128)

rune (actually int32 represents a Unicode code point)
